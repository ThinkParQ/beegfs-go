// Worker defines the external facing interface used to interact with all worker
// node types. Specific worker node types must implement this interface along
// with the grpcClientHandler interface and add a typed constant in Config
// before they will be usable. Note common methods are implemented by the
// baseNode type, which all worker node types are expected to embed.

	// Implemented by the base node type:
	GetID() string
	GetState() State
	GetNodeType() Type
	Handle(*sync.WaitGroup, *flex.UpdateConfigRequest, *flex.BulkUpdateWorkRequest)
	Stop()
	// Implemented by specific node types:
	//
	// SubmitWork() should only return an error if the request was definitely not created on
	// the node. Otherwise this can lead to orphaned requests because BeeRemote assumes an error
	// means the request could not be sent to the node or created due to an internal node error.

// grpcClientHandler defines the interface for managing gRPC connections in
// worker nodes. Implementers of this interface are responsible for establishing
// and terminating gRPC connections and clients specific to their node type.
// This interface enables a common handler implementation through dependency
// injection. Implementations must ensure that they set the grpcClientHandler in
// their respective constructor functions.
//
// The interface consists of two methods:
//   - connect: Establishes a gRPC connection and initializes a gRPC client of the appropriate type
//     that is reused for all unary RPCs. After the new client is setup it should update the
//     configuration and state of any existing work requests on the node. It should return false if
//     an error occurred that is fatal (i.e., remote node was unable to update config or WRs) or
//     true if an transient error occurred that can be retried (i.e., network connectivity).
//   - disconnect: Cleanup the gRPC connection and client that was created for this node.
//     It should return an error if there were any problems freeing these resources.
//
// Note: Connect and disconnect operations should be idempotent and safe to call
// multiple times.

	stateMu sync.RWMutex
	config  Config
	// The mutex serves two purposes: (1) guarantee only one Handle() methods
	// for each node at a time. (2) guarantee when dynamic configuration updates
	// happen the old node handler has finished shutting down before we swap out
	// the node or delete it.
	nodeMu sync.Mutex
	// Context for the overall node. When cancelled the node will wait up to the
	// DisconnectTimeout for any outstanding RPCs to complete before they are
	// forcibly cancelled. IMPORTANT: After the node context is cancelled the
	// node must be recreated using newWorkerNodeFromConfig() before it can be
	// used again.
	nodeCtx    context.Context
	nodeCancel context.CancelFunc
	// When an RPC request is made the WG is incremented then deincremented
	// when the RPC completes. This is used to check for outstanding RPCs
	// when a disconnect is requested, allowing us to wait up to the
	// DisconnectTimeout for RPCs to complete before cancelling them.
	rpcWG *sync.WaitGroup
	// Context used for all RPCs. Can be cancelled to force outstanding RPCs to
	// complete if the DisconnectTimeout is exceeded. Note tis context is
	// initialized when the node is created using newWorkerNodeFromConfig(),
	// then also reinitialized every time connect is called otherwise we'd
	// never be able to reconnect or call any RPCs after a disconnect. Note the
	// initialization in newWorkerNodeFromConfig() shouldn't be required, but is
	// done to avoid a segmentation fault if the handle method were to change in
	// a way where the context could be cancelled before connect was called.
	rpcCtx    context.Context
	rpcCancel context.CancelFunc
	// rpcErr is used by unary RPC functions to notify the handler in the event
	// of an unrecoverable error to indicate the worker node should be marked as
	// offline. When sending to this channel it is important to use a
	// non-blocking send pattern using a select statement with a default case.
	// This is necessary because multiple RPCs may simultaneously encounter
	// errors, but only a single notification is needed to inform the handler to
	// set the node offline. A non-blocking send prevents RPCs from being
	// blocked and ensures after the node reconnects an RPC that was previously
	// blocked doesn't send a stale offline notification which would make the
	// node offline again.

// While gRPC handles most aspects of managing connections with worker nodes,
// because these nodes are stateless we must first send them configuration and
// tell them what to do with any outstanding work requests before they can
// handle new work requests and are considered "online". After a node is online,
// if any unary RPC results in an error the state will move to offline and
// we'll verify we can reconnect to the node and send the configuration. This
// way if a worker node was rebooted or the service restarted, it gets the
// correct configuration and knows how to handle any outstanding WRs.
