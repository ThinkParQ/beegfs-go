// field (commonly message can change but status should not, or we want to keep
// a message history).
//
// IMPORTANT: Because this is the last known status, when handling UpdateJob
// requests don't assume the WorkRequest status is current. Instead always send
// the request to the worker node to ensure it is updated. Update requests are
// expected to be idempotent so if the WR is already in the requested state no
