// Package RST (Remote Storage Target) implements wrapper types for working with
// RSTs internally and clients for interacting with various RSTs.
//
// Most RST configuration is defined using protocol buffers, however changes to
// this package are needed when adding new RSTs:
//
//   - Add a new typed constant with the internal type of the RST.
//   - Expand the map of SupportedRSTTypes to include the new RST.
//   - Add a new type for the RST that implements the Client interface.
//   - Add the RST type to the New function().
//   - Add support for the new RST type to the desired Job types
//     (via their allocate/deallocate methods).
//
// Note once a new RST type is added, changes to its fields largely should not
// require changes to this package (if everything is setup correctly).

// The type of an RST is determined by the oneof field in the
// RemoteStorageTarget protocol buffer defined message. We alo internally
// maintain a separate typed constant for each RST type to simplify determining
// what RST type we're working with, notably for the purposes of generating the
// appropriate segments. This also allows mocking the behavior of any real RST
// type by using a Mock client that returns the type of the desired RST.

// SupportedRSTTypes is used with SetRSTTypeHook in the config package to allows
// configuring with multiple RST types without writing repetitive code. The map
// contains the all lowercase string identifier of the prefix key of the TOML
// table used to indicate the configuration options for a particular RST type.
// For each RST type a function must be returned that can be used to construct
// the actual structs that will be set to the Type field. The first return value
// is a new struct that satisfies the isRemoteStorageTarget_Type interface. The
// second return value is the address of the struct that is a named field of the
// first return struct and contains the actual message fields for that RST type.
// Note returning the address is important otherwise you will get an initialized
// but empty struct of the correct type.
