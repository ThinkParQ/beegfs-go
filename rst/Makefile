# For details on what licenses are disallowed see

# steps have been taken based on the license requirements also ensure to add 
# justification below.
# 
# === Justification for Ignored Licenses === 
# 
# github.com/hashicorp/hcl: Distributed under MPL 2.0 which is a copyleft (reciprocal) license.
#   By default we consider reciprocal licenses a disallowed type because we need
#   to manually verify our use doesn't violate the license terms. Here our use
#   of an MPL 2.0 license is acceptable because we don't modify any of the
#   original source. Note this exists in the project because we use Viper
#   creating an indirect dependancy on HCL. However we don't allow users to use
#   HCL for configuration so technically we don't even use this at all.
