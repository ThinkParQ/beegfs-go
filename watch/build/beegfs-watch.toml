#
# --- Section 2: [Command Line Arguments] ---
#

# Use the command line argument "--cfg-file=/etc/anotherconfig.conf" to specify a different config
# file for bee-watch. All other options in this file can also be used as command line arguments, or
# set using environment variables, overriding the corresponding config file values. See `bee-watch
# --help` for details on how to configure BeeWatch using flags and/or environment variables.


#
# --- Section 3: [Basic Settings Documentation] ---
#

# Where indicated, BeeWatch configuration can be updated without restarting BeeWatch by updating
# this file then running `systemctl reload bee-watch`.


#
# --- Section 3.1: [Logging Settings] ---
#

# Logging configuration must be specified under [log]. Except the log level, this configuration
# cannot be updated after the application is started.

# level: Adjust the logging verbosity. Supported levels:
# 0 - Fatal Only (not recommended).
# 1 - Fatal + Error
# 2 - Warn + Error + Fatal
# 3 - Info + Warn + Error + Fatal
# 4, 5 - Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal
# Note: Levels above 3 might decrease performance.

# type: Defines the logger type. This can either be "syslog" to send log messages to the general
# system logger, "logfile", "stderr", or "stdout". If set to 'logfile' logs will be written to the
# below file and rotated based on the provided settings. 

# file: The path to the desired log file when logType is 'logfile'. As needed the directory and all
# parent directories will be created.

# max-size: When type is set to 'logfile' this is the maximum size of the file in megabytes before
# it is rotated.

# num-rotated-files: When type is 'logfile' the maximum number old file(s) to keep when max-size is
# reached and the log is rotated.


#
# --- Section 3.2: [Management Settings] ---
#

# Configuration for the BeeGFS management service must be specified under [management]. This
# configuration is used to verify licensing and cannot be updated after the application is started.

# address: The IP address and gRPC port for the BeeGFS management service. 

# tls-disable-verification: Set to true to skip verifying the management TLS certificate. This
# allows traffic to be encrypted, but puts the client at risk of a man-in-the-middle attack since it
# cannot verify the management service is the expected one.

# tls-ca-cert: Specify the path to a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for verifying
# the Management node's identity. If left empty, the system's default certificate pool will be used
# to verify the node. Alternatively, a path to a specific CA certificate (either signed by a trusted
# authority or self-signed) can be provided. Example: /etc/beegfs/cert.pem

# tls-disable: Set to true to send all gRPC messages including potentially sensitive information
# about file paths/names inside the file system will be sent in clear text over the network.

#
# --- Section 3.3: [Metadata Settings] ---
#

# Configuration for the BeeGFS metadata service BeeWatch is listening to must be specified under
# [metadata]. This configuration cannot be updated after the application is started.

# event-log-target: The path where the BeeGFS metadata service expected to log events to a unix
# socket (should match sysFileEventLogTarget in beegfs-meta.conf).

# event-buffer-size: How many events to keep in memory if the BeeGFS metadata service sends events
# to BeeWatch faster than they can be sent to subscribers, or a subscriber is temporarily
# disconnected. Worst case memory usage is approximately (10KB x sysFileEventBufferSize). 

# event-buffer-gc-frequency: After how many new events should unused buffer space be reclaimed
# automatically. This should be set taking into consideration the buffer size. More frequent garbage
# collection will negatively impact performance, whereas less frequent garbage collection risks
# running out of memory and dropping events. 


#
# --- Section 3.4: [Handler Settings] ---
#

# Configuration for subscriber handlers must be specified under [handler]. This configuration
# applies to all subscribers and may be updated after the application has started.

# max-reconnect-back-off: When a connection cannot be made to a subscriber subscriber reconnection
# attempts will be made with an exponential back off. This is the maximum time in seconds between
# reconnection attempts to avoid increasing the back off timer forever.

# max-wait-for-response-after-connect: When a subscriber connects/reconnects wait this long for the
# subscriber to acknowledge the sequence ID of the last event it received successfully. This
# prevents sending duplicate events if the connection was disrupted unexpectedly. 

# poll-frequency: How often subscribers should poll the metadata buffer for new events (causes more
# CPU utilization when idle).


#
# --- Section 4.1: [Basic Subscriber Settings] ---
#

# Configuration for each subscriber must be specified under a new [[subscriber]] header.
# Configuration options in this setting should be specified for each [[subscriber]] they apply to.
# Subscribers may be added, removed, and updated after the application has started.

# id: The `id` option is used to keep track of what events should/have been sent to a particular
# subscriber. This means all other subscriber configuration (including the type) can be changed
# without losing events intended for a particular subscriber as long as the ID remains the same. 

# name: The `name` option no special significance and is intended to help users identify this
# subscriber in logs and configuration files.

# type: The `type` option is used to specify what protocol should be used to communicate with this
# subscriber. Additional options will be needed based on the provided type. Support types: 'grpc'.


#
# --- Section 4.2: [gRPC Subscriber Settings] ---
#

# The configuration options in this section must be specified under each [[subscriber]] when the
# subscriber's type is set to 'grpc'.

# grpc-address:
# The IP address or hostname and port of the subscriber. No default.

# grpc-disconnect-timeout: When a local disconnect is requested, how long to wait (in seconds) for
# the remote subscriber to also shutdown their end of the connection before just closing the
# connection. If this value is to short then we may not receive acknowledgement of events the
# subscriber has processed (subscribers should resend the acknowledgement when they reconnect). If
# this value is to long, then reconfiguration attempts or shutting down BeeWatch may hang for an
# inconvenient amount of time. Default: 30 (seconds).

# Using TLS to encrypt events sent to subscribers: Because file system modification events can carry
# potentially sensitive information, it is recommended to use TLS to authenticate subscribers and
# encrypt all communication. If subscribers are configured to use a valid certificate signed by a
# recognized Certificate Authority (CA), or your organization is using its own signing server and
# adding the necessary certificate(s) to the system running BeeWatch, no additional steps will be
# required. If this is not the case there are a few options: 

# tls-ca-cert: Specify the path to a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for verifying
# the subscriber's identity. If left empty, the system's default certificate pool will be used to
# verify the subscriber. Alternatively, a path to a specific CA certificate (either signed by a
# trusted authority or self-signed) can be provided. Example: /etc/beegfs/cert.pem

# grpc-tls-disable-verification:
# Set to true to skip verifying the subscribers TLS certificate. This allows
# traffic to be encrypted, but puts the client at risk of a man-in-the-middle
# attack since it cannot verify the subscriber is the expected one.

# grpc-tls-disable: Set to true to send all gRPC messages including potentially sensitive
# information about file paths/names inside the file system will be sent in clear text over the
# network.
