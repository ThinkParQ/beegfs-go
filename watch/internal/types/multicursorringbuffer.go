// MultiCursorRingBuffer is an optimized single writer multi-reader data structure.

// The buffer should only be written to by a single writer using Push so no typically no locks are required.
// The buffer may be read by N SubscriberCursors, so long as they have locked their respective mutexes.
// Lock contention between the writer and readers only happens when freeing up space that requires a SubscriberCursor to be moved.
// Otherwise events can be added to the buffer and subscribers can get/ack those events with no lock contention.
